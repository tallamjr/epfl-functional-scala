### COURSE 1: Functional Programming Principles in Scala

> Functional programming is becoming increasingly widespread in industry. This trend is driven by the
> adoption of Scala as the main programming language for many applications. Scala fuses functional and
> object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and
> Javascript. Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including Apache
> Spark, Kafka, and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, Tumblr and
> also Coursera.

> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to
> apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for
> reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of
> execution symbolically. The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as
> illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them.
> The course is complemented by a series programming projects as homework assignments. Recommended
> background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is
> ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also
> sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

### COURSE 2: Functional Program Design in Scala

> In this course you will learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger
> applications. You'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation
> to structuring your libraries using monads. We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from
> state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. You’ll also learn some
> best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world.
>
> Several parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts with
> mutable state. We will explore the consequences of combining functions and state. We will also look
> at purely functional alternatives to mutable state, using infinite data structures or functional
> reactive programming. Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to: - recognize
> and apply design principles of functional programs, - design functional libraries and their APIs, -
> competently combine functions and state in one program, - understand reasoning techniques for
> programs that combine functions and state, - write simple functional reactive applications.
> Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with
> Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby
> is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line. This course is intended
> to be taken after Functional Programming Principles in Scala:
> https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1.

### COURSE 3: Parallel programming

> With every smartphone and computer now boasting multiple processors, the use of functional ideas to
> facilitate parallel programming is becoming increasingly widespread. In this course, you'll learn
> the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular,
> you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel
> paradigm. We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections
> operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections
> library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through
> several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means
> clustering.
>
> Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to: - reason about task and data
> parallel programs, - express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel, -
> competently microbenchmark parallel code, - write programs that effectively use parallel collections
> to achieve performance Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming
> experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++,
> Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command
> line. This course is intended to be taken after Functional Program Design in Scala:
> https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2.

### COURSE 4: Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

> Manipulating big data distributed over a cluster using functional concepts is rampant in industry,
> and is arguably one of the first widespread industrial uses of functional ideas. This is evidenced
> by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop, and most recently Apache Spark, a fast, in-memory
> distributed collections framework written in Scala. In this course, we'll see how the data parallel
> paradigm can be extended to the distributed case, using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's
> programming model in detail, being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar
> programming models, like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections. Through
> hands-on examples in Spark and Scala, we'll learn when important issues related to distribution like
> latency and network communication should be considered and how they can be addressed effectively for
> improved performance.

> Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to: - read data from persistent
> storage and load it into Apache Spark, - manipulate data with Spark and Scala, - express algorithms
> for data analysis in a functional style, - recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in
> Spark, Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency
> with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or
> Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line. This course is
> intended to be taken after Parallel Programming: https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1.

### COURSE 5: Functional Programming in Scala Capstone

> In the final capstone project you will apply the skills you learned by building a large
> data-intensive application using real-world data.
>
> You will implement a complete application processing several gigabytes of data. This application
> will show interactive visualizations of the evolution of temperatures over time all over the world.
> The development of such an application will involve: — transforming data provided by weather
> stations into meaningful information like, for instance, the average temperature of each point of
> the globe over the last ten years ; — then, making images from this information by using spatial and
> linear interpolation techniques ; — finally, implementing how the user interface will react to
> users’ actions.
